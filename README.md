## About

ramsey/php-library-starter-kit is a package that may be used to generate a basic
PHP library project directory structure, complete with many of the starting
files (i.e. README, LICENSE, GitHub issue templates, PHPUnit configuration,
etc.) that are commonly found in PHP libraries. You may use the project
directory that's created as a starting point for creating your own PHP libraries.

<!-- USAGE_START -->
## Usage

``` bash
composer create-project ramsey/php-library-starter-kit YOUR-PROJECT-NAME
```

Running this command will create a new repository containing the same files
and structure as this repository. Afterward, it will run the
`Ramsey\Dev\LibraryStarterKit\Wizard::start()` method to set up the project, which will
walk you through a series of questions and make changes to files based on your
answers. When complete, it will remove the `./src/LibraryStarterKit` and `./tests/LibraryStarterKit`
directories, leaving everything else in place with an initial commit.

### Using An Existing Answers File

When executing `create-project`, if you exit the program while in the middle of
the question prompts, you might notice it creates a `.starter-kit-answers` file
in the project directory. When you return later and run `composer starter-kit`,
it will use this file to pre-fill any questions you've already answered. Once
finished, the starter kit removes this file.

You may also use an existing answers file to provide all your answers to the
prompts, including skipping the question prompts. To do this, set an environment
variable with the path to your answers file:

```shell
STARTER_KIT_ANSWERS_FILE=/path/to/starter-kit-answers.json
```

To skip the question prompts, make sure you include the `skipPrompts` property
in the answers file, and set it to `true`.

The answers file is a JSON object, consisting of all the public properties found
in `Ramsey\Dev\LibraryStarterKit\Answers`.

For example:

```json
{
    "authorEmail": "author@example.com",
    "authorHoldsCopyright": true,
    "authorName": "Author Smith",
    "authorUrl": "https://example.com/",
    "codeOfConduct": "Contributor-2.0",
    "codeOfConductCommittee": null,
    "codeOfConductEmail": "conduct@example.com",
    "codeOfConductPoliciesUrl": null,

    "copyrightEmail": "author@example.com",

## FAQs

### Why did you include package/tool *x* and not *y*?

I created this project starter kit for my own uses, and these are the
common files, packages, and tools I use in my PHP libraries. If you like what
you see, feel free to use it. If you like some of it but not all, fork it and
customize it to fit your needs. I hope you find it helpful!
